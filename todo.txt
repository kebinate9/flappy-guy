TODO
1. Add obstacle sprites
   Obstacle sprites have been added however we need a way to automate
   this and randomise their locations within an upper and lower bound.

2. Add collisions
   This only needs to be between flapper and pipe obstacles. Clouds
   do not count as obstacles and we can ignore these.

3. Make text go rainbow
   I just want to see if I can figure out a way to do this.

4. Create power-up
   Create the image

5. Equip a power-up
   Flapper needs to move along the screen along with the
   power-up. (Copy the coordinates in a way that looks like
   he is holding the thing).

6. Make power-up do something
   E.g. If the power-up is a gun, make it shoot in the 
   direction of the mouse cursor when clicked.

7. Add soundtrack to the game
   This should be easy and I just need to find a good 
   soundtrack, I could even change the soundtrack depending
   on what is happening in the game.

8. Add other sound effects
   Applies to in-game events like jumping, dying etc.
